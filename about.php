									</div>
									<p style="text-indent:20px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><span style="font-size:160%;"><i><strong>Infinity Home Furnishings</strong></i></span>, formerly known as Guiao’s Home Furnishings, was established in 1968 by the newlyweds Jesus S. Guiao and Julieta O. Guiao. By that time, they were just in their early 20’s and only had 10,000 pesos with them. Even so, they weren’t neophytes in the furniture industry. Mr. Jesus Guiao, together with his siblings, was raised by his father in a furniture environment in Betis, Pampanga, which is famously known for its quality furniture.</p>
									<p style="text-indent:20px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Catering to all classes around Pampanga, Bataan, Bulacan and nearby provinces, the business grew from a 200 sq. meter site (near the San Fernando Elementary School) to an approximately 1200 sq. meter building just across Iglesia Ni Cristo Church along B. Mendoza St. This was all due to the hard work and efforts of the owners and their constituents, and the blessings of the Almighty God. The main core of business are retail sales of furniture ranging from beds, sala sets, dining tables, wardrobes, and many other furniture needed in every home of families from all walks of life and for offices as well. The furniture on display came from suppliers from different manufacturers in Manila, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, and Pampanga.</p>
									<p style="text-indent:20px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">During the calamities which were brought about by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo and different typhoons, the business had its ups and downs, but stood strong with the unending support of our suki, who kept on coming back every time they needed some furniture, and, of course, the help of God. The excellent quality of service and the furniture itself attracted customers and gained their trust. With that, we always aimed higher and new additions of items and designs were added constantly every time there were new products in the market. Now, the furniture also has lines of imported items from new suppliers in Malaysia, China, and Thailand.</p>
									<p style="text-indent:20px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Though it is the only branch of the family, in the 50 years of serving Kapampangans and the neighboring provinces, it continuously flourishes. The business also continued to prosper even though there were various malls built all over the province. Even though we have the same suppliers as them, we still continue to serve our customers with more affordable prices. The two floors of the building are always full of stock and it has never had a vacant spot because day after day, new furniture arrive and get delivered.</p>
									<h3 class="text-center" style="color:gray ;"><i>"We aim to further bring trendier and more modern design styles, at an affordable price, to always satisfy your needs and to keep up with the development of the country, especially in the furniture industry."</i></p>
